# Table

This project contains registration, authentication, data and user pages.
Used technologies: Angular, SCSS, Firebase, Express.

On the data page there is a table with infinite scrolling - initially 20 records, if the scrollbar is pulled down, then another 10 records are loaded. The record consists of the first name, last name, address and phone number. Records are generated randomly from JSON files. You can also select the language of the generated data(EN/RU).

The user page contains a table with all registered users and a toolbar for deleting/blocking/unblocking a user.
